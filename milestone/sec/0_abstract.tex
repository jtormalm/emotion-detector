\begin{abstract}
This project explores facial emotion recognition (FER) using deep learning techniques. A ResNet18 model is trained on the FER2013 dataset to classify facial expressions into seven emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral. The system is designed for efficient, real-time performance on Apple M1 hardware. Preliminary experiments show the model reaching around 68\% accuracy on the test set after 10 epochs, with strong results for the \textit{happy} and \textit{surprise} classes. A live webcam demo using OpenCV has also been implemented, capable of detecting faces and predicting emotions in real time. Future work will focus on improving class balance, tuning hyperparameters, and enhancing robustness under different lighting and pose conditions.
